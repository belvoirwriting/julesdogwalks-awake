This is Ernie, the very happy, playful red cocker spaniel.

## Your dog's new friend

Ernie is our family dog and loves to play, to run and to meet other dogs with similar interests. Let him help your dog socialise, build confidence and just have fun. 

## Paid in biscuits
Ernie is chief taste tester for my range of homemade dog biscuits made with all natural ingredients. They give him that extra boost to bounce after balls.

## Woof from Granby
Ernie lives with us in Granby, Nottingham, and walks and socialises with other dogs from all over the Vale of Belvoir. Get in touch today if your dog wants to join Ernie on a sociable walk or if they would prefer a solo jaunt for that much needed 'me-time'. My official launch is in October 2021 but you can get your dog's name on the list today, just email julesdogwalks@gmail.com.
