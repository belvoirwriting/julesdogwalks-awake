It's good news from Granby with only a short wait before your new favourite dog walking service launches.

## Your Vale of Belvoir dog walker

I will walk your dog, provide a place for it to be during the day while you work or treat yourself to some time off, or even give it a bed for a few nights so you can enjoy that well-earned break.

## Fresh air and fun for your dog in the Vale of Belvoir

I run my dog walking service from our cottage in Granby but I walk and host dogs from all over the Vale of Belvoir. So, if you're in Bottesford, Muston, Redmile, Plungar, Langar, or elsewhere in the Vale, your dog will find a very warm welcome.

## Book your place today

My official launch is in October 2021 but you can get your dog's name on the list today, just email julesdogwalks@gmail.com or use the form on the contact page.
